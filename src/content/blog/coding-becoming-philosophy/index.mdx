## Introduction

We are slowly moving into an age where AI is growing more and more &apos;intelligent&apos; and it is a matter of time before we start to ask fundemental questions we still have not found answers to. Questions like:

- What is intellgence?
- What is consciousness?
- What is understanding?
- What is knowledge?
- What is reality?

There is a video on youtube by one of my favourite current philosophers, Alex O&apos;Connor, titled [&quot;Why Can&apos;t ChatGPT Draw a Full Glass of Wine?&quot;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=160F8F8mXlo).
I reccommend everyone watch this video since, it is funny but also how he deals with the problem and explains is quite well done.

## Empiricism

The main point I want to focus on is David Hume&apos;s idea of empiricism which states:

- Impression which is something we experience through our senses.
- Ideas which are the mental representations of those impressions. &quot;A weaker, more faded version of the original impression.&quot;

Then comes the two types of ideas:

- Simple ideas which are the basic building blocks of our thoughts and perceptions.
- Complex ideas which are the combination of simple ideas to form more complex thoughts and perceptions.

This form of understanding leads us towards thinking that most knowledge is a posteriori, meaning it is derived from experience and observation. And by default we can not know anything without having experienced it first. I like to think the best form of learning also happens via getting your hands dirty and doing things yourself.

### The Problem

He leaves us with a finding where we really can&apos;t tell if this form of thinking is valid, since we don&apos;t have a way to necessarily prove/disprove it. This is where the problem lies, and this is where I think we can start to see the connection between coding and philosophy.
We don&apos;t really understand, &quot;understanding&quot;, &quot;knowledge&quot;, &quot;intelligence&quot; only how we perceive and interact with them, which can be different from person to person.
This feel&apos;s like a category error, when we put the term intelligence on something that is not intelligent but a probabilistic guess based on the data it has seen before. It is like saying a calculator is intelligent because it can do math, but it is not intelligent, it is just a machine that does math.
Like to give something intelligence we need to understand what intelligence is, and we don&apos;t know what it is.

What made it easier for me to understand is trying to define creativity. Defining creativity would limit the idea of creativity to a set of rules and guidelines, which is not what creativity is. Creativity is the ability to think outside the box and come up with new ideas and solutions. It is not something that can be defined or limited to a set of rules.

## AGI - Artificial General Intelligence

Well we don&apos;t know how to define intelligence, it is currently a moving goal post across on what the technical community defines as AGI. A certain benchmark of solving questions, but those questions are made on questions that are already solved by humans. So it is a bit of a paradox, where we are trying to create something that we don&apos;t know how to define.

## The Opposition

If we don&apos;t know what intelligence is, what do you call something that can solve complicated problems which have never been seen before?
